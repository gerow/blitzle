It's (on its way to being) a gameboy emulator!

Done
* CPU is mostly working
* Video displays bg
* Add support for ROM banking
* Render output to gl texture instead of PNGs

Todo
* Sprites -- somewhat implemented but completely broken
* Input -- it works, but need some kind of logic to make the buttons stickier
* Timer is timing -- not sure why this is broken
* Sound
